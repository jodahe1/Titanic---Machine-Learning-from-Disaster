# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

## Description
This project focuses on the famous **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** dataset, a classic problem for beginners in data science and machine learning. The goal is to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on features such as age, gender, class, and more. The project involves:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the dataset, identifying patterns, and visualizing key insights.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.
- **Model Building**: Training and evaluating machine learning models to predict survival.
- **Model Optimization**: Fine-tuning hyperparameters and improving model accuracy.

This project is ideal for learning the end-to-end process of a machine learning workflow, from data exploration to model deployment.

## Key Insights and Analysis

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution of passengers by age, gender, and class.
   - Survival rates based on passenger class, gender, and embarkation point.
   - Correlation between features (e.g., fare and survival).

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values in age, cabin, and embarked columns.
   - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., sex, embarked) for model compatibility.
   - Feature engineering (e.g., creating family size from siblings/spouse and parents/children).

### 3. **Model Building**
   - Training and evaluating models such as:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
     - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
   - Comparing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 4. **Model Optimization**
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
   - Feature importance analysis to identify key predictors of survival.

## Project Structure

### 1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Load the dataset and perform initial checks (e.g., missing values, duplicates).
   - Explore basic statistics and data distributions.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize survival rates by gender, class, and age.
   - Analyze the impact of fare and family size on survival.

### 3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values (e.g., impute age, drop irrelevant columns).
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding for 'Sex' and 'Embarked').
   - Create new features (e.g., family size, title extraction from names).

### 4. **Model Building**
   - Split data into training and validation sets.
   - Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models.
   - Compare model performance using evaluation metrics.

### 5. **Model Optimization**
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy.
   - Analyze feature importance to understand key predictors.

### 6. **Prediction and Submission**
   - Generate predictions on the test dataset.
   - Save predictions in the required format for Kaggle submission.
